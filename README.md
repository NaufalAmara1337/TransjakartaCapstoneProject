## About

In this project I am analyzing Transjakarta. PT. Transportasi Jakarta or Transjakarta is a company operatiing in the transportation sector. Transjakarta is a regional government owned business. Of which a large part of its stock is owned by the regional government of Jakarta. Founded in 2004, Transjakarta serves as a transport service that operates on the roads of Jakarta. Transjakarta aims to connect the life of Jakarta by provifing integrated transportation service to ease and bring happiness in the life of Jakarta.

The analysis process is as follows:

1. **Business Context**, Analyzing the situation revolving around Transjakarta in Jakarta. In this section, we breakdown Transjakarta's structure, its competitors and organization as a whole.
2. **Data Transformation**, Evaluating the condition of the data. Checking for outliers, anomalies and null values. Also, we added a number of new columns to give a broader picture on the scope of Transjakarta
3. **Data Analysis**, Analyzing data.
4. **Conclusion and Recommendation**, Providing conclusions based on analysis, giving action recommendation, and a follow-up plan.
